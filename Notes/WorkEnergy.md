# Work - Energy Approach

## The Power Method for Systems

The power method proveis and alternative to the classical Newtonian/D'Alember approach for linked systems:

- It can give quick answers in many cases
- It considers teh system a sa whole and does not require separate FBDs
- It is based on the concepts of work, energy and power
- The approach requires the identification of power sources and sinks for the system

To use the method you will need to have:

1. Kinetic Energy
2. Potential Energy
3. Work Done by forces and torques/moments
4. Power of forces and torques/moments
